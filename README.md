## 🧠 What is TXT OS?

TXT OS is a full-stack semantic reasoning system powered by plain `.txt` files — zero installs, no boilerplate, just logic.  
It looks like Notepad. It thinks like Gödel.  
You don’t run it — you read it.

TXT OS modules are ultra-portable semantic programs designed to be interpreted by large language models. Each `.txt` is a highly compressed reasoning engine, capable of triggering deeply structured AI behaviors with almost no noise, no hallucination, and no prompt engineering.

## 📦 Core Modules (5 Products)

All five modules are powered by the WFGY engine and tuned for different kinds of reasoning.  
Each module uses a single `.txt` file to control everything from logic flow to persona shaping and image semantics.

### [**1. TXT-Blah Blah Blah**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlahBlahBlah)  
> *Semantic Q&A Engine*  
The only Q&A where the fun is just the beginning. Designed to simulate dialectical thinking, handle paradoxes, and respond with emotionally intelligent phrasing — no training, just WFGY logic.  
**Status**: 🔓 Lite / 🔐 Pro

---

### [**2. TXT-Blur Blur Blur**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlurBlurBlur)  
> *Image Generation Interface*  
Poetic, stable, high-density image prompts — Blur enables AI to "see" meaning before it draws. Capable of rendering paradox, visualizing logic, and fusing metaphors with consistent ΔS = 0.5 balance.  
**Status**: 🔐 Lite / 🔐 Pro

---

### [**3. TXT-Blow Blow Blow**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlowBlowBlow)  
> *Reasoning Game Engine*  
An AIGC-based text RPG where every battle is a logic puzzle. Like a Game Boy for AI cognition — build your own philosophical boss fights and watch the model think instead of guess.  
**Status**: 🔐 Lite / 🔐 Pro

---

### [**4. TXT-Blot Blot Blot**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlotBlotBlot)  
> *Humanized Writing Layer*  
From bullet points to essays with voice and soul. Blot tunes LLMs to write with nuance, irony, and emotional realism — finally, outputs that read like a real person, not a template.  
**Status**: 🔐 Lite / 🔐 Pro

---

### [**5. TXT-Bloc Bloc Bloc**](https://github.com/onestardao/WFGY/tree/main/OS/BlocBlocBloc)  
> *Prompt Injection Firewall*  
A semantic firewall that doesn’t block — it out-thinks.  
Using ΔS gating, λ_observe logic traps, and drunk-mode interference, Bloc defeats prompt injection even when the attacker knows the rules.  
**Status**: 🔐 Lite / 🔐 Pro

## 💡 Why it works

- 🧮 Based on mathematical logic, not pattern prediction.
- 🧱 Built on the WFGY Engine (萬法歸一引擎): a unified model of meaning.
- 🧘‍♂️ Fully symbolic. Fully semantic. Fully TXT.

TXT OS isn't just a hack.  
It's the start of a new reasoning era.
